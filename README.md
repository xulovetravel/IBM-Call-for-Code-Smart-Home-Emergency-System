# IBM-Call-for-Code-Smart-Home-Emergency-System
This is the repo for IBM Call For Code Internal team Smart Home Emergency System. In emergencies (e.g. earthquake), currently there are no efficient ways for rescuers to communicate, locate, and evaluate survivorsâ€™ situations quickly, conveniently, and accurately, to accomplish well-planned and successful rescue works. To solve this problem, we propose and develop Smart Home Emergency System (SHES), which facilitates the rescue works during emergencies.
